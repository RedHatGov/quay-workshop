# Lab 5 - Working with images

## Skopeo
Skopeo has a number of advantages over using other "all-in-one" tools like the docker cli. For starters, Skopeo can move images without an intermediary registry or daemon. Meaning, we don't need a local registry running on our host to store an image, re-tag, and push an image to a new registry. Skopeo can copy an image from one registry to the next, without storing anything locally. Additionally, Skopeo can do fancy things like inspect an image remotely, take an exported tar file of a container image and copy it to a remote registry and more. The advantage here is that we don't need access to a local container runtime to achieve these image management operations, which makes Skopeo a great tool for running within a container as we are in this workshop.

The command structure for Skopeo will feel new when in comparison to the docker cli, because of the various transports in which Skopeo can transfer an image, but when compared to a basic linux `cp` (copy) command, it's quite simple. Because of this, we have to tell Skopeo when we're interacting with a docker V2 API registry using the `docker://` transport mechanism. Other options exist if you're interested in reading more here [Skopeo Copy to the Rescue](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/skopeo-copy-rescue)

The approach is as simple as `skopeo copy <transport>:<source> <transport>:<dest>`. Just like the copy command, it's source on the left and destination on the right.

## Skopeo Login
First, we'll need to log into our registry to be able to write an image to your registry. Quay makes this easy, and will create a timeboxed encrypted password for you to use, so you're not forced to leave your sensitive credentials in a terminals session history.

From the Quay dashboard:
* Click your username dropdown `quay` in the top right
* Click `Account Settings`
* `Generate Encrypted Password`
* Enter your password `openshift` -> Click `verify`
* Click `Docker Login` on the left
* Copy the the `docker login -u...` contents on the right by clicking the `Copy to Clipboard` icon

Back on the terminal:
* Paste in your login command (ctrl+shift+v)
* Replace the word `docker` with `skopeo`
* Append this flag to the end of your command `--tls-verify=false` (we're doing this bc of self signed certs on the Quay route)
* Press enter, you should see the following: `Login Succeeded!`

## Pull an image from Quay

* From the Quay dashboard, click on the `test` repository
* Click the `tags` icon
* Under the text `Pull this container with the following Docker command:`, click the copy button
* You've copied the docker pull command to the clipboard

From within the terminal tab to the right of your dashboard:
* Paste in the contents of the clipboard, (ctrl + shift + v) for example:

 `docker pull quayecosystem-quay-quay.apps.cluster-1c69.1c69.example.opentlc.com/user1/test`

Replace `docker pull ` with `export DEST_IMAGE_URL=`, we'll be using `Skopeo` instead. For now we just want to store the image URL in an environment variable for ease of use later. The end result should look something like this:
`DEST_IMAGE_URL=quayecosystem-quay-quay.apps.cluster-1c69.1c69.example.opentlc.com/user1/test`


Check that we've actually stored that variable!:
```execute
echo $DEST_IMAGE_URL
```
Your result should be similar to the example above. If not, repeat the previous steps.

Back over in the Quay console, navigate to the `user1org/centos-mirror` repository.
* Click the `Tags` icon on the left
* Choose a tag, and on the right side (beside the SHA) click the fetch tag icon
* For Image Format, select `Docker Pull (by tag)`
* Copy the contents starting with the word `quayecoysystem...`

Back to the terminal, let's save this image URL as our `SRC_IMAGE_URL` for ease of use below. 
* Paste the contents of your clipboard into the terminal (ctrl + shift + v)
* Prepend your pasted image url with the following `export SRC_IMAGE_URL=`, leave no space between the `=` and the pasted image URL.

Check that you've stored the SRC_IMAGE_URL:
```execute
echo $SRC_IMAGE_URL
```
Your response should be something like this:
```
[user1:~] $ echo $SRC_IMAGE_URL
quayecosystem-quay-quay.apps.cluster-3798.3798.example.opentlc.com/user1
org/centos-mirror:7.0.1406
```


Using the URLs you've stored as variables from above, lets use skopeo to move a copy of something from one Quay repo over to another. This is to simulate the same 

```execute
skopeo copy --src-tls-verify=false --dest-tls-verify=false docker://$SRC_IMAGE_URL docker://$DEST_IMAGE_URL:latest
```
 
 *Note the use of the tls-verify=false flags. This is necessary because we're using a non-trusted CA to sign the certificate that fronts this lab instance of Quay*


 ## Optionally, Tag an image as latest
The Quay UI offers a trivial way (aside from just CLI tagging) to change image tags. For example, we'll assign the tag `latest` to an image in the `test` repo.

* From the Quay dashboard, click on the `test` repo
* Click the `tags` icon
* Click the gear icon to the right of the SHA
* Click `Add New Tag`
* Enter `7.0` as the tag name
* Notice how Quay is drawing a link between the two tags now, to denote these tags are sharing the same image.
